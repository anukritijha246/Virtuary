# Virtuary- A VR experience

Virtuary is a Virtual reality application made using A-frame which aims at creating an experience of visiting a shrine or temple or any religious place virtually. It also has a meditation experience with calming sounds.
The app has two subparts:
Sacred Hall: A virtual experience of the inner sanctum of a holy place.
Tranquil. io: A virtual meditation experience.

## Reason for a virtual solution

Religious places attract thousands of people every year. Pilgrims undergo arduous journeys to reach there only to catch a glimpse of the inner sanctum or the deity. Since thousands of people undertake such journeys every year, it is difficult for authorities to regulate the crowd. Moreover, if a natural calamity strikes, it leads to a huge loss of life.

## Aims

A virtual reality tour of the inner sanctum of the religious place. The user would be able to experience soothing temple sound and can offer flowers to the deity.

Moreover the app will also have an option of attending a meditation virtual space which will have soothing music and flowing animated water.

## Advantages of a virtual solution

This can not only improve user experience but also help the authorities in controlling and diverting the number of people attending the holy place. It can also mitigate risks due to natural calamities. The system does not propose to completely remove physically attending pilgrimages. It is just an alternative based on interest. It is subjective based on their ethics.

## Requirements

As this is just a prototype, simple models and random 3D images have been chosen. For this app, 3D models have been constructed using primitive shapes supported by the framework (which is not very artistic ðŸ˜…). For a real app, high quality 3D images of the inner temple sanctum has to be used.

## Future Scope of Improvement

Several additional funtionalities can be attached to the existing app.  To improve the user experience, a live feed of the inner sanctum of the shrine can be used. Along with this, better 3D models can be added. In the meditation app, a yoga training section can also be added. Better 3 D models can significantly improve user experience.
